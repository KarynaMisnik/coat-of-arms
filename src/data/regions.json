      "regionDescription": "The coat of arms of Åland depicts a golden red deer set against a blue background, topped with a traditional Swedish-style comital coronet. The coat of arms originally designed for Åland (two roe deer with nine roses) was mistakenly used by Öland (Sweden), and Åland instead adopted Öland's red deer design. This mix-up was not discovered until the 1940s, after Åland had been ceded to Finland. Finnish heraldic authorities chose not to correct the mistake, allowing Åland to keep the red deer. To prevent further confusion, Sweden modified Öland's coat of arms by adding a red collar and attire to the deer.",

In 1878, a new design was created by Governor-General Adlerberg, featuring a golden M for Maria and a stag, which was approved in 1881. After Finland's independence, the old coat of arms faced criticism, leading to a design competition in 1948. Nils Byman won, and the new coat of arms was approved in 1949. The current design, based on Byman's work, was finalized in 1957. The coat of arms symbolizes main industry, seafaring, and parks, where lime trees are common. It features a blue shield with a gold anchor standing upright, and above it, three green lime tree leaves."

The right arm, armored, wields a sword, while the left, covered in chain mail, holds a curved saber. All elements are silver, except for the golden hilts of the weapons and the joint rings on the armor.'The crossed arms and weapons are inspired by the historical coat of arms of Karelia, with colors traditional to the region. The wavy bar symbolizes Lake Saimaa and other regional waterways. This coat of arms was created by architect Tuula Taskula and approved by the South Karelia Regional Council on April 2, 1997. Before adopting this coat of arms, South Karelia used one designed by heraldist Olof Erikson in the 1980s, though it did not become widely recognized as a regional symbol. The historical coat of arms of Karelia represented South Karelia within the former Kymi and Southern Finland provinces, while the Province of Viipuri used Viipuri’s old city coat of arms. In 1989, heraldist Jukka Suvisaari designed a traditional house flag for South Karelia, featuring white, red, and yellow from the Karelian coat of arms—distinct from Karelia’s black-and-red house flag. On December 10, 2002, the South Karelia Regional Council also adopted a provincial flag that combines the coat of arms’ crossed arms with the black-and-red of the traditional Karelian flag.",

The wild man symbol references Lappeenranta's former name, Lappstrand, later reinterpreted in 1721 as Willmanstrand ('wild man’s shore') due to the old Swedish term lapp, meaning 'wild man'. After Sweden ceded Lappeenranta to Russia in 1743, the city adopted a modified coat of arms in 1788 based on this early seal, initially on a blue field. By 1892, George Granfelt's Finlands städers vapenbok depicted it on a silver field, a version that eventually became standard. Olof Eriksson's 1954 redesign introduced this silver field officially, along with a golden mural crown symbolizing Lappeenranta's fortress. The city’s former Nuijamies movie theater, now a cultural venue, takes its name from the wild man figure on the coat of arms."

Created in 1997 by the Regional Council of South Ostrobothnia, the coat of arms was designed under the guidance of heraldic expert Touko Saari. The ermines, adapted from the historical Ostrobothnia coat of arms (which originally featured six), symbolize purity and wealth. Northern Ostrobothnia now uses the historical coat of arms without a crown, while Ostrobothnia retains ermines in its current emblem. Central Ostrobothnia, meanwhile, uses a marten-based design from an earlier version. The coat of arms also inspired the provincial flag, formally introduced on May 22, 2000. In June 2020, the regional council approved expanded flag use for official events and encouraged municipalities to display it. The colors of the coat of arms and flag are also found in South Ostrobothnia’s traditional house banner.",

The bear's head, taken from Ilmajoki's parish seal, symbolizes the municipality’s independence from Isojoki in 1532. The same bear also appeared on Isojoki's and Lapua's early seals. The maces and foot cross refer to the 1596–1597 peasant revolt and were originally linked to Jaakko Ilkka’s mark. However, later research confirmed the mark belonged to Yrjö Kontsa.

In the other version, a hot copper vein rose from the lakebed, creating such dense steam upon contact with the water that it made the entire lake appear to be ablaze. The blazon reads: 'A silver-blue shield divided by a wavy line, with three red flames rising in the upper field and a silver pike swimming in the lower field.'

The design of Lapua's coat of arms originates from the old parish seal. The earliest seal, dating back to 1599, featured only a forward-facing bear's head. This bear symbol was first used by the parent parish of Isojoki and was later adopted by Lapua and Ilmajoki when they became independent parishes. By the 18th century, after the original seal was lost during the Great Northern War, the image evolved to depict a man riding a bear and holding a club, a motif that became synonymous with Lapua and was also used in the seal of the Lapua district. Heraldic artist Gustaf von Numers designed the current coat of arms. It was approved by the Lapua municipal council on September 25, 1950, and officially sanctioned by the Ministry of the Interior on December 11 of that year."

The design is a variation of the Savonia region's historical coat of arms, used in its crownless form by North Savonia. Early versions of Savonia's coat of arms showed the bow in the same orientation as South Savonia's, which is considered a heraldic exception. The Savonian bow appears in the coats of arms of Mikkeli and Savonlinna and in the traditional Savonian host banner.",

To honor this tragedy, the coat of arms includes silver oars, representing the boating accident. The four clovers on the shield symbolize agriculture, reflecting the area's farming roots. The coat of arms, designed by Olof Eriksson based on an earlier version, was officially adopted on November 23, 1954.

The blazon reads: ‘In a blue field, three flying silver cranes arranged in the shape of a right-pointing arrow.’ It was initially granted as the municipal coat of arms of the town of Suolahti on February 12, 1952. The design is inspired by the marshy bay that gave the area its name, which serves as a resting place for cranes during migration. In 2007, Äänekoski adopted this coat of arms following the merger of the municipalities of Äänekoski, Suolahti, and Sumiaiset. The original coat of arms of the town of Äänekoski, granted on October 14, 1954, was designed by Gustaf von Numers. Its blazon was: ‘In a black field, a wavy silver bar with three red horns and straps.’ This design, a ‘speaking’ coat of arms, was inspired by the town's name, with the wavy bar symbolizing the rapids and the horns representing sound."

The lower section of the shield depicts a blue net. Designed by herald Gustaf von Numers in 1951 for the Kymenlaakso Regional Council, the design references the Kymijoki River, a historic and vital salmon river. The colors of blue and silver were chosen to highlight the region’s natural heritage and its connection to the coastal municipalities historically considered part of Uusimaa. The coat of arms was adopted in 1997 after the regional administrative reform and had previously been part of the Kymen Province's heraldry from 1962 to 1997.",

Hamina’s coat of arms is the only municipal coat of arms in Finland that incorporates purple. The blazon reads: ‘In a blue field, a silver, wavy timber log with a golden boat floating on it, above which is a golden royal crown with purple lining.’ The coat of arms of Hamina was designed by Gustaf von Numers, drawing inspiration from the city's original arms."

In the current coat of arms, the anchor symbolizes Kotka’s significance as a port city, and the caduceus (Mercury's staff) represents trade, industry, and transportation."

In 1892, heraldist George Granfelt created the first version of the modern coat of arms, drawing inspiration from the town's first seal. The tree motifs in the seal were interpreted as spruces in the coat of arms. The blazon reads: ‘In a waved silver and blue shield, in the right field, eleven green spruces growing from the field, arranged 3 + 3 + 3 + 2.’ The current coat of arms was re-drawn by Olof Eriksson, and it was approved by the Kristinestad town council on June 30, 1960.

Founded by royal privilege on September 7, 1620, Uusikaarlepyy adopted the image of a burning tar barrel as its emblem in the founding document, symbolizing the significance of the tar trade to the people living along the Ostrobothnian riverbanks. A similar design, with only slight differences in the orientation of the tar barrels, was also created for the city of Kokkola (formerly known as Gamlakarleby, or ‘Old Kaarlepyy’), which was founded the same year. The tar barrel motif appeared in various forms on Uusikaarlepyy’s administrative seals. To distinguish Uusikaarlepyy’s coat of arms from Kokkola’s, the residents of Uusikaarlepyy began to favor a blue and gold version, which was officially adopted by President Risto Ryti on November 19, 1943. The blazon reads: ‘In a blue shield, a golden tar barrel standing upright, with golden, red-tipped flames emerging from the lid and both sides.’ The updated design was redrawn by heraldist Gunnar Clément."

The current design was finalized in the 1920s and remains a symbol of the city’s heritage and history. The blazon reads: ‘In a red field, the golden symbol of the Vaasa family, beneath which hangs a gold-and-white Cross of Liberty, surrounded by golden laurel wreaths and swords, suspended from a golden ribbon inscribed with two red lines, which encircles the bottom of the shield.’ The new version of the coat of arms was redrawn by Eric O.

The main motif is derived from the von Numers family, whose roots lie in Maksamaa. The symbols in the coat of arms reflect the region's cultural and economic activities. The water spirit represents the area's connection to water and the fishing industry, while the fish in its right hand and the cloverleaf in its left symbolize the local natural resources and agricultural traditions.
