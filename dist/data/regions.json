By the 18th century, after the original seal was lost during the Great Northern War, the image evolved to depict a man riding a bear and holding a club, a motif that became synonymous with Lapua and was also used in the seal of the Lapua district.

When Jämsä and Jämsänkoski merged in 2009, the latter's coat of arms was adopted as the official emblem of the city. The current look of the coat of arms of Jämsä was designed by Gustaf von Numers."

The coat of arms' colors reflect the Swedish-speaking population's heritage, aligning with Finland's national colors and appearing in the traditional flag of Ostrobothnia's Swedish-speaking community. The emblem of the House of Vasa was also featured in the former Vaasa Province's coat of arms. The coat of arms was designed by heraldist Juhani Vepsäläinen on September 28, 1997.",

This seal remained in use until the Great Wrath (the Swedish-Russian war), when its iron and brass copies were sent to Sweden. In 1892, heraldist George Granfelt created the first version of the modern coat of arms, drawing inspiration from the town's first seal. The tree motifs in the seal were interpreted as spruces in the coat of arms. The current coat of arms was re-drawn by Olof Eriksson, and it was approved by the Kristinestad town council on June 30, 1960. The Ministry of the Interior confirmed the coat of arms for use on November 25, 1960."

Founded by royal privilege on September 7, 1620, Uusikaarlepyy adopted the image of a burning tar barrel as its emblem in the founding document, symbolizing the significance of the tar trade to the people living along the Ostrobothnian riverbanks. A similar design, with only slight differences in the orientation of the tar barrels, was also created for the city of Kokkola (formerly known as Gamlakarleby, or ‘Old Kaarlepyy’), which was founded the same year. The tar barrel motif appeared in various forms on Uusikaarlepyy’s administrative seals. To distinguish Uusikaarlepyy’s coat of arms from Kokkola’s, the residents of Uusikaarlepyy began to favor a blue and gold version, which was officially adopted by President Risto Ryti on November 19, 1943. The updated design was redrawn by heraldist Gunnar Clément."

Its design likely originates from the funeral banner used at the burial of King Gustav Vasa of Sweden in 1560, although it may have been created earlier during his reign. The oldest known depiction, from the Armorial suédois (1562), shows only the arms and swords. A crown was later added in Gustav Vasa's tomb in Uppsala Cathedral. The crossed arms reflect Karelia's history as a contested borderland between Sweden and Russia, symbolizing the region's many battles. These elements also feature in Finland's national coat of arms. The current version of the coat of arms was finalized in 1962 by the Ministry of the Interior, with heraldist Ahti Hammar drafting its official description. ",

This significant landmark served as a boundary marker following the Treaty of Pähkinäsaari in 1323 and was recognized by the Russians in the late 15th century. The boulder bears engravings of a crown and a cross, symbolizing its role as a territorial marker. The goose in the design likely represents the area's natural environment, as geese are common in the region.  The coat of arms was designed by Olof Eriksson, and was approved by the Pyhäjoki municipal council in their meeting on June 18, 1965. The Ministry of the Interior confirmed its use on September 22 of the same year."

      "regionDescription": "The bow motif is interpreted as symbolizing Savonia's position as the easternmost border province of Sweden before the incorporation of North Karelia in 1617. This design was first seen at the funeral of King Gustav I in 1560, when the Savonian coat of arms appeared among the banners of Sweden's provinces. It is believed that the design of the provincial coats of arms, including Savonia's, was commissioned by the royal court during the reign of King Gustav, particularly under the influence of his sons, who had an interest in heraldry.  The current coat of arms of Savonia was designed by the heraldic artist Ahti Hammari. It was officially adopted in 1962, based on Hammari's design, which solidified the heraldic details and structure of the coat of arms as we know it today.",

The bear motif has deep roots, evolving from a 14th-century seal depicting Saint Olaf with a royal orb and axe. It gained prominence as a regional symbol through its use in local crown bailiff seals in the 1800s. Current look of the coat of arms was designed by Ahti Hammari in 1963.",

He was likely sent by the King of Sweden to establish Christianity in the region, where he became a bishop. According to legend, Bishop Henry met his death in Köyliö, in what is now the municipality of Säkylä, during a violent confrontation with the local pagan population. The most famous version of his death recounts that while riding to meet a local nobleman named Lalli, the bishop was attacked by Lalli, who struck him with an axe, killing him. This event is often seen as a martyrdom, and Bishop Henry is venerated as a saint in the Finnish Lutheran Church. The coat of arms of Säkylä was originally approved as the coat of arms of Köyliö on September 26, 1950. It was designed by Into Linturi and Yrjö Rintala. Following the municipal merger in 2016, it became the coat of arms of the unified municipality of Säkylä."

The Latin motto Deus protector noster ('God is our protector') appeared on the seal. After the Great Wrath in the 18th century, Pori used a new seal with a bear rising from the bottom, which later became part of its coat of arms. By the late 19th century, a knight’s crown was added, and in 1931, artist Eric O. W. Ehrström's design with a wall crown and motto was officially adopted.

The cross is believed to symbolize the city's Franciscan monastery and the Church of the Holy Cross, while the 'r' letters are thought to refer to the city's name. Over time, later seals depicted the cross separately, with the 'r' letters replaced by the initials R, A, U, and M. The design was officially adopted as the city's coat of arms in 1793. The coat of arms is based on the city's medieval seal from 1490.  A revised version of the coat of arms, redrawn by Carolus Lindberg, was formally adopted by presidential decree on September 11, 1942. The current design, which includes the golden crown of the Duke of Satakunta, was finalized on November 2, 1992.

The earliest example of its coat of arms is from a 1599 runestone by Johannes Bureus. The boat symbol, representing Swedish settlers and Uusimaa's coastal location, was used in various contexts, including on Charles IX’s 1606 coin and in the 1617 Swedish City Law. The wave-crested logs represent the region’s rivers, rather than trade or seafaring.  Unlike the historical province (and Uusimaa County), the current province does not use the count's crown above the coat of arms. The crowned coat of arms was used as the symbol of Uusimaa County until 1997, and as part of the South Finland Province's coat of arms from 1997 to 2009. The current look of the coat of arms is based on a design by Ahti Hammari in 1962. ",

The coat of arms was redrawn based on the old design by Ahti Hammar, and it was approved by the city council of Loviisa on September 12, 1968, and January 8, 1969. The Ministry of the Interior confirmed the use of the coat of arms on March 18, 1969. In the 2010 municipal merger agreement between Loviisa, Liljendal, Pernaja, and Ruotsinpyhtää, it was decided that the new city would retain the name Loviisa, and a design competition would be held for its new coat of arms.

The monastery's Latin name was Vallis Gratiae, meaning 'Valley of Grace,' which was translated into Swedish as nådens dal. The city that grew around the monastery was named after it. The initials of the Latin name were incorporated into the city’s seal, depicted beneath an open knight’s crown to symbolize the monastery’s protection. In later seals, the letters were also adorned with laurel leaves.  George Granfelt described Naantali’s coat of arms in its present form, without the laurel leaves, in his 1892 book on Finnish municipal heraldry. This version remained in use until the 1960s, when heraldist Olof Eriksson redrew the design. The Naantali city council approved Eriksson's version on July 26, 1966, and the Ministry of the Interior confirmed it on October 11, 1966."

The image symbolizes her triumph over evil, drawing from her legend. According to Christian tradition, Saint Margaret, also known as Margaret of Antioch, was a virgin martyr of the early church. In her story, she is swallowed by a dragon while imprisoned for her faith, but escapes unharmed after the cross she carries irritates the dragon's insides, causing it to release her. Vehmaa's coat of arms is the only municipal emblem in Finland to feature a dragon. The coat of arms was designed by Ahti Hammar and approved by the Vehmaa Municipal Council on November 28, 1957. It was officially confirmed by the Ministry of the Interior on February 19, 1958."
